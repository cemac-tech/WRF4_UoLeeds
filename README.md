# WRF4_UoLeeds

### Guidance on using WRF4 on the UoLeeds ARC3 system

This code repository contains copies of two files that are used to invoke an environment on the University of Leeds HPC for running WRFv4 from a pre-built installation that resides under the `earwrfa` account. This installation is designed primarily for use as part of an undergraduate teaching module in Practical Weather Forecasting.

The files are: 

```WRFv4``` - private modulefile that sets the paths to required libraries and dependencies;

```WRFv4_setup_env.sh``` - used to invoke the private module and set up some test environments for running the model. 

More details on how to invoke the WRF environment and run it on ARC3 are available [here](https://github.com/cemac-tech/WRF4_UoLeeds/wiki/WRFv4-on-ARC3:-User-documentation)

Full details of the compilation method are available [here](https://github.com/cemac-tech/WRF4_UoLeeds/wiki/Compiling-WRFv4.0-on-ARC3). These notes may also be used as a guide by University of Leeds researchers who wish to build their own local instance of WRFv4 for model development work.

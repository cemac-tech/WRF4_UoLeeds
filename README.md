# WRF4_UoLeeds

### Guidance on using WRF4 on the UoLeeds ARC systems

This code repository contains copies of two files that are used to invoke an environment on the UoLeeds HPC for running WRFv4. 
These are: 

```WRFv4``` - private modulefile that sets the paths to required libraries and dependencies;

```WRFv4_setup_env.sh``` - used to invoke the private module and set up some test environments for running the model. 

Full documentation on the compilation method is available [here](https://github.com/cemac-tech/WRF4_UoLeeds/wiki/Compiling-WRFv4.0-on-ARC3)

Notes on how to invoke the WRF environment and run it on ARC3 are available [here](https://github.com/cemac-tech/WRF4_UoLeeds/wiki/WRFv4-on-ARC3:-User-documentation)
